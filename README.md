# SilverChef

SilverChef is an android app developed for Govtech Hackathon 2017. The theme was aging population and Silver Chef was made
to tackle the feeling of loneliness and uselessness in our treasured elderly. 

What our app primarily does is to connect young aspiring cooks with our experienced old ones. 

It uses firebase API to handle
and manage requests and meetings which allows user matching. After a meeting between two users have been scheduled
they are able to go into a live video chat at the agreed meeting time. This live video is done using WebRTC video. The most 
important part of Silver Chef is probably the intuitive UI which we specailly designed for elders who are not familiar with
smart phones.
